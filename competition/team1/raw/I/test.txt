To generate a stable structure that looks like the character "I" and meets all the hard constraints, we can use the following approach:

1. Place the b31 block at the center of the map, aligned with slot 9, and drop it to the base layer.
2. Place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 block, one on each side, aligned with slots 8 and 10, respectively, and drop them to the base layer.
3. Place the b13 block on top of the b31 block, aligned with slot 9, and drop it to the base layer.


The resulting structure will look like the character "I" and will meet all the hard constraints. Here's the Python code to implement this approach:

```
# initialize the structure as an empty WxH grid
structure = [[' ']*W for _ in range(H)]

# place the b31 block at the center of the map and drop it to the base layer
ab_drop('b31', 9)

# place two b11 blocks on top of the b31 block, one on each side, and drop them to the base layer
ab_drop('b11', 8)
ab_drop('b11', 10)

# place the b13 block on top of the b31 block and drop it to the base layer
ab_drop('b13', 9)

```

The resulting structure will meet the no boundary intrusion constraint because all the blocks are placed within the map's boundaries.
